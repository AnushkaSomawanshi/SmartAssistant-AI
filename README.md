# JARVIS - VOICE ACTIVATED AI ASSISTANT
VirtualAssistant is a Python-based voice-activated virtual assistant designed to simplify daily tasks through natural speech commands. It offers a variety of features, including real-time weather updates, music playback, note-taking, reminders, and web searches. With its ability to interact through voice, the assistant provides a seamless hands-free experience, making it both practical and engaging. Powered by libraries like pyttsx3, speech_recognition, and wikipedia, it can speak responses, recognize user commands, and fetch relevant information. The project also integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to deliver accurate weather information.
To get started, clone the repository and install the required Python libraries using pip. Additionally, configure your OpenWeatherMap API key by replacing YOUR_API_KEY in the code. Once set up, you can run the program and start interacting with Jarvis by saying commands like "Search [topic] on Wikipedia," "What's the weather in [city]?" or "Play music." The assistant is equipped with features like unit conversion, motivational quotes, and simple arithmetic calculations, making it versatile for daily tasks.

This project is built with Python 3.8+ and uses libraries such as pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, pygame for music playback, and requests for API calls. It is ideal for exploring the capabilities of voice-enabled task automation and can serve as a foundation for more advanced virtual assistant projects.
